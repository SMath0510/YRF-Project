1. **Undirected Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - Determines the shortest path between two nodes in a graph where edges have no direction, using algorithms like Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall.

2. **KDTree Usage for Calculating Nearest Points:**
   - Utilizes KDTree data structure to efficiently find points within a specified radius, beneficial for spatial queries and nearest neighbor searches in multidimensional space.

3. **Multiprocessing for CPU-Specific Tasks:**
   - Employs multiple processes to execute CPU-bound tasks concurrently, harnessing the power of multiple CPU cores to enhance performance for parallelizable computations.

4. **Multithreading (and Ineffectiveness for CPU-Specific Tasks):**
   - Involves running multiple threads concurrently; however, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, multithreading might not significantly boost performance for CPU-bound tasks.
